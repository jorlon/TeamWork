Provisioned ec2 micro with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS image.
SSh at port 22 was already added to the security group.
Added http port 80 to security group.
then added https at port 443.
Lauched then I selected the sucurity key used for the test ec2 set up.
Took note of the ip address.

I used sftp to get the file onto the server because I could not copy file because of the public key.
To run the oua-wda-assignmnet-1.sh

chmod +x oua-wda-assignment-1.sh to grant executable privileges.

then I was able to sudo bash '' the file.

Success!
