I logged into mysql by setting up root and pasword.
I then created an a1 user and a password
Granted all privileges on the winestore database after creating it.
then wget -O winestore.data from the url
and loaded it into the database.

I setup phpmyadmin as a back up to terminal.
Check winestore database to confirm it was transfered into my database.
