The design of the website will be as follows

WINESTORE
		IMG	
			->images.png etc.
		INCLUDES
			LAYOUT
				->footer.php
				->header.php
				->navigation.php
			->config.php
			->dbconnection.php
			->function.php
			->sessions.php
		JS
			->jsMin.js
			->modenizer.js
		STYLE
			->stylesheet.css
		->index.php
		->answer.php
		->search.php

Where names in capitals representing folders and files indicated by -> and have extentions.

I have set up the struture this way as to seperate like groups of files. The server by default will target index.php
there for its at the front of the hierarche then all folders and files are accessable from inside the files.

The design of the application is from any user on the internet wanting to query for wines.
The theme is influenced from red wine and complimenting colours were chosen to give a averall feeling
of athentically searching a winestore.

The design is user freindly with multiple links to search page with easy to understand navigation.
